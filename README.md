# Diagnosing-Malaria-Disease-using-HRnet-Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model that can diagnose malaria disease using HRnet algorithm. The model is trained on the [Malaria Cell Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria) and can classify images into two categories: parasitized and uninfected.
