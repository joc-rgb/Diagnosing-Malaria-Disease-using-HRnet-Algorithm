This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model that can diagnose malaria disease using HRnet algorithm. The model is trained on the [Malaria Cell Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria) and can classify images into two categories: parasitized and uninfected.

### Context : 
   Malaria poses a global health problem, and the number of cases and deaths are alarmingly increasing over the recent years worldwide. The current blood inspection and traditional method of malaria detection and diagnosis are time consuming and prone to error. Early detection of malaria is important as it allows for timely treatment that provides faster and more accurate diagnosis for patients while significantly improving the chances of a full recovery and reducing the risk of complications and death.
### ðŸŽ¯ Objective :
   We have to use this dataset to generate a classification model that can successfully detect malaria based on the cell images.
### Deep Learning Model used :
- HRNet
